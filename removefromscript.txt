- The left panel displays actual data points colored by their true class labels.
- The right panel illustrates decision boundaries and overlays it with the actual data points.

- The trained model predicts the class labels for each point in the meshgrid.

- The decision boundaries are visualized on the right panel using a filled contour plot.
- This plot helps us understand how the model categorizes different regions in the feature space.

Introduction:
This code creates a visual representation of a decision tree model's predictions on synthetic data. It emphasizes modeling and simulation, showcasing how the trained model makes decisions and separates different classes in a two-dimensional feature space. The visualizations highlight the model's understanding of patterns learned during training, offering insights into its predictive capabilities.

Project Overview:

This code follows several key steps in the modeling and simulation process:

1. **Data Generation:**
   - Generates synthetic data based on specified class properties, creating a simulated dataset for training and testing the decision tree model.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
   - Converts the synthetic data into a structured DataFrame and visualizes its distribution. This step helps understand the characteristics of the dataset and aids in feature exploration.

3. **Modeling:**
   - Splits the data into training and testing sets, then trains a decision tree classifier on the training data. The model learns patterns and relationships between features and class labels.

4. **Simulation (Decision Boundaries Visualization):**
   - Visualizes decision boundaries created by the trained model. This step illustrates how the model separates different classes in the feature space, providing a simulated representation of its decision-making process.

5. **Evaluation:**
   - Evaluates the model's performance on the test set by predicting class labels and calculating accuracy. This step assesses how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.

6. **Analysis:**
   - Further analyzes the model's predictions by visualizing actual versus predicted data points. This step offers insights into the model's strengths, weaknesses, and its ability to distinguish between different classes.

Each step contributes to the overall process of modeling and simulating a decision tree classifier. Data generation sets the foundation, exploratory data analysis helps understand the dataset, modeling and simulation train the model and visualize its decision boundaries, evaluation measures its performance, and analysis provides insights for interpretation.
